       consists of a scalar or vector value of some integer or

       with some metadata such as a signal's range, unit, or other

/*! @defgroup monitor Monitors

    @{ Monitors are the primary interface through which a program may
       observe the network and store information about devices and
       signals that are present.  Each monitor has a database of
       devices, signals, connections, and links, which can be queried.
       A monitor can also make link and connection requests.  In
       general, the monitor interface is useful for building GUI
       applications to control the network. */
